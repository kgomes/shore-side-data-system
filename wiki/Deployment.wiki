#summary Information about how the SSDS software is normally deployed in any environment
#sidebar TableOfContents

These are the instructions to help you get SSDS installed and running on your server.  This is not an easy task, but hopefully these detailed instructions will make it palpable.  These instructions have been tested on Mac OS X and CentOS.  Haven't tried Windoze yet ...

First the stuff you need:

  * Java 7+ SDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * Wildfly 8+ (http://www.wildfly.org)
  * Apache Tomcat 7+ (http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)
  * Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
