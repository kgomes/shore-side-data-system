The Monterey Ocean Observing System (MOOS) project at MBARI (http://www.mbari.org/moos/) was a multi-year project that MBARI undertook to build platforms and infrastructure to enable ocean observatories.  The goal was to give us assets that would provide a comprehensive view of a section of the ocean and give the science community better access to information as it was happening in the ocean.

To meet the data management needs of the MOOS system, the SSDS was designed and constructed to consume, catalog and make available, all data and metadata from the ocean observatory as well as any data processing that happened after the raw data was collected.

This page documents the high level requirements that the SSDS was designed to address.
